# The-Gamerz-Blog

For this project, the goal is to build a gaming blog that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, MySql, Express, Handlebars, Bootstrap, and Heroku skills. This blog will allow users to make blogs and add comments to each blog post. In addition, the benefits of using this blog would to enhance the gaming community's cross platforming.

## Description

This blog on the Home page for this Blog we created a homepage where all the blogs and comments are displayed. This is the main landing page for the website, showcasing the latest or most popular blog posts and allowing users to interact through comments. In the About Us page, we used the Bootstrap framework for layout and styling. On this page, we added pictures and descriptions of the individuals behind the blog, giving visitors some insight into the people responsible for the content. In the Gaming Pages (Nintendo, Xbox, PC Gaming, PlayStation); the blog covers different gaming platforms, and you've created separate pages for each of them. These pages feature blog posts and allow users to post their own content or comments related to these gaming platforms. We implemented routing for all these pages. Routing ensures that when users click on different sections or pages of your website, they are directed to the appropriate content without requiring a full page reload. Users can post their own content related to Nintendo, Xbox, PC gaming, and PlayStation, as well as leave comments on existing posts. This engagement can create an active and vibrant online community. On this blog we styled everything with CSS but we also used SASS which was a special library for CSS.

- User Story: AS A gamer, I WANT to interact and post blogs, SO THAT the community can comment on the blog posts.
